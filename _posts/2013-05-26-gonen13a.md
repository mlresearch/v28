title: Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization
abstract: 'We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment
  and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as
  different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization
  to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users
  in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold
  start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the
  output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward.
  We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic
  formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient
  variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally
  feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included,
  treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals
  which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives
  in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our
  framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering
  samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our
  algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification
  data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms.'
